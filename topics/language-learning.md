# What is language learning?

Language learning is learning a language. Cool, how do we do that? There's no "universal way to master any language in X months", but it seems that the best way to become provicient in a specific language is by getting a lot of input. There's a lot to say but for now I'll simply drop some tools I like and use (or used to use):

| Type              | Link                               | What's that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
